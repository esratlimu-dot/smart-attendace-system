A Smart Attendance System is a modern solution designed to automate and simplify the process of tracking attendance in schools, universities, and workplaces. Instead of relying on traditional manual methods like paper registers or roll calls, this system uses advanced technologies such as RFID cards, biometric recognition (fingerprint, facial, or iris scan), QR codes, or mobile applications to record attendance efficiently.
